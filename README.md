Overview
This repository implements the Perceptron Learning Algorithm to classify 3-dimensional points into two classes. It iteratively updates weights until convergence and analyzes the impact of learning rate and epochs on classification accuracy. Additionally, it determines the number of linearly separable binary classification problems from a given dataset.



Features
Implementation of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm for 3D data
Iterative weight updates until convergence
Evaluation of linear separability in binary classification
Impact analysis of learning rate and epochs on accuracy
Support for multiple class combinations for robust validation



Results & Analysis
The perceptron will converge if the data is linearly separable
Higher learning rates may cause oscillations, while lower rates may slow convergence
If data is not separable, perceptron will not converge
